# Task Lists

This is actually pretty cool to me! (Btw, this is how you make a task list)

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](https://www.google.com), **formatting**, and `<del>tags</del>` supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
